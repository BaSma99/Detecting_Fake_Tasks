 Detecting_Fake_Tasks
 
 Problem overview: 
      
      - Fake tasks are harmful for MSC platform and for the users and participants, so itâ€™s mandatory 
        and critical to remove them. The machine learning models can be used to help us to identify the 
        fake tasks and deal with them and improve the performance of the MSC platform.

Implementation steps:
      
      1- Import important libraries and load the dataset from the link: 
          http://nextconlab.academy/MCSData/MCSFakeTaskDetection.html
          
          - This dataset is generated by the CrowdSenSim simulation tool. 
      
      2- Get some information about the data.
      
      3- Show the imbalance of Ligitimacy column data.
      
      4- Show the Scatter geo figure between the Latitude and Longitude columns.
      
      5- Split the dataset into train(80%) and test(20%) split.
      
      6- Apply Random Forest classifier.
      
      7- Apply AdaBoost classification model.
      
      8- Apply GaussianNB classifier.
      
      9- Apply Hard Voting.
      
      10- Apply Soft Voting.
      
      11- Apply Weighted Sum aggregation.
      
      12- Compare between Random forest, AdaBoost and GaussianNB classifiers:

      13- Comparing between voting and weighted ensemble:

 Conclusion: 
      
      - After applying the Random forest, AdaBoost and GaussianNB to identify the fake 
         tasks, we found that the Random forest model has the higher accuracy, and the 
         ensemble weighted sum model has the same accuracy like voting classification 
         models.
